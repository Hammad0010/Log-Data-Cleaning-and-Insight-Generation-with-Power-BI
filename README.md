# BI Project: Log Data Cleaning and Insights

## Project Overview
This Business Intelligence (BI) project focuses on processing log files to extract meaningful data, clean and prepare it for analysis, and ultimately generate insights using Power BI. The project involves scripting in Python for data cleaning and uses Power BI for visualizing the data.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Scripts to transform raw log data into a clean, analyzable format.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Power BI to create dynamic visualizations that provide actionable insights.
- **Automation**: Automating the process of data cleaning and loading to Power BI.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting and automating the data cleaning process.
- **Power BI**: To create and share interactive reports and dashboards.
- **Git**: For version control.
## Visualizations

The following are some key visualizations created using Power BI from the cleaned and processed data. These visuals help in understanding the trends and patterns hidden in the log data.
